# push_swap

Push_swap is a project that aims to create an efficient sorting algorithm using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using the fewest possible moves.

## Key Features

- Sorting algorithm implementation using two stacks: a and b
- Optimization for efficiency with minimal operations
- Handling of various input sizes, from small sets to 500 numbers

## Usage

```bash
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```
This command will output a list of operations to sort the given numbers.

This will check if the operations generated by push_swap correctly sort the stack.

## Available Operations

- `sa` : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a
- `sb` : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b
- `ss` : sa and sb at the same time
- `pa` : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a
- `pb` : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b
- `ra` : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1
- `rb` : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1
- `rr` : ra and rb at the same time
- `rra` : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1
- `rrb` : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1
- `rrr` : rra and rrb at the same time

Push_swap is an excellent project for understanding sorting algorithms, optimizing code, and working with abstract data types in C.
